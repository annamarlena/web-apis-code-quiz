// Gary's Tips:
// Need global variables
// Need functions
// Need a way to cycle through all the answers and store them
// Start off by making 2 generic questions and run tests till working right
// Test in short, controlled areas, can always make everything bigger later on
// Don't make timer really long
// Test functions in isolation: write the function, call the function to test it
// Preferable not to have an event listener for each of the buttons
  // Have a global event listener for any click on the page

  var timer
  var score = 0;
  
// User arrives at web page
// Click the button

function start() {

  
}
  // First question appears
  // Timer starts

  // Listen for user to click on one of the answers

// When an answer is clicked
  // Determine if it's right or wrong

    // If it's right

    // If it's wrong
