# Web APIs Code Quiz

## Objective

The objective was to create a timed quiz. The quiz uses vanilla JavaScript and web APIs to dynamically cycle through an array of objects that contain questions and potential answers. Any time an incorrect answer is selected, additional time is subtracted from the clock. Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over and the quiz-taker can save their answers and score in local storage.


## What I Learned

Working with vanilla JS and web APIs is not my idea of fun. My final result is mostly functional, but it's not pretty. Right now you can click on the list item answers, but they aren't buttons, and I don't have the final piece working where you capture the initials and final score and store them locally. Other than that, I think my biggest lesson here was not to give up!
